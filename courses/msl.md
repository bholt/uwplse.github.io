# MSL: a Synthesis Enabled Language for Distributed Implementations

## Abstract

MSL is an experimental language with synthesis feature for writing
bulk-synchronous SPMD (single program multiple data) parallel programs. It
shows that by leveraging a high level abstraction of the SPMD programming
model, one can do deep semantic analysis of SPMD programs, and even
synthesize them. In this talk I will introduce the MSL programming model,
demonstrate the necessary restrictions to the communication model that make
the program synthesis feasible, and present the experimental results of MSL
generated code.

## Bio

Zhilei Xu is a PhD student in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He
works with Prof. Armando Solar-Lezama on Program Synthesis, with focus on
synthesizing parallel programs for high performance computing. Besides the
work he does for a living (i.e. program synthesis), he also loves anything
related to the intersection of programming languages and systems.
