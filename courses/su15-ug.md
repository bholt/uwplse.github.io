## Underground Reading Group: Classic Papers in Distributed Systems (Summer 2015)

We meet once a week (starting after PLDI) to discuss classic papers. Here are some ideas.

* [A hundred impossibility proofs for distributed computing](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/MIT-LCS-TM-394.pdf)
* [Unreliable Failure Detectors for Reliable Distributed Systems](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=226643.226647)
* [Viewstamped Replication Revisted](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf)
