## UW SE Seminar (Spring 2014)

### *Mon 3:30pm in CSE 203*

We'll be reading and discussing exciting recent papers from the
software engineering community.  Participants should subscribe to the
[590p mailing list](https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/cse590p). Note
the list also has many current and former department members
interested in programming languages.

Some paper links may point into the ACM Digital Library or the
Springer online collection. Using a UW IP address, or the UW
libraries' off-campus access, should provide access.
